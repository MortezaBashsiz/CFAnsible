# config file for ansible -- http://ansible.com/
# ==============================================

# ansible.cfg in the current working directory, .ansible.cfg in
# the home directory or /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg, whichever it
# finds first

# By default, this option is disabled to preserve compatibility with
